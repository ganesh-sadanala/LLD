#### Use Cases

- Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:
  - StackOverflow likely follows the MVC architectural pattern to separate the application logic into three interconnected components: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (handles user input and updates the model and view).
  - This pattern promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the application more modular, maintainable, and easier to test.
- Repository Pattern:
  - The Repository pattern is often used to abstract the data access layer and provide a centralized place to manage data operations.
  - In StackOverflow, repositories can be used to handle database interactions, such as retrieving questions, answers, user profiles, and other entities, while hiding the complexities of the underlying data storage.
- Caching Pattern:
  - Given the high traffic and read-heavy nature of StackOverflow, caching can be employed to improve performance and reduce the load on the database.
  - Caching patterns like In-Memory Caching or Distributed Caching can be used to store frequently accessed data, such as popular questions, user profiles, or search results, in a fast-access cache.
- Decorator Pattern:
  - StackOverflow has features like badges and privileges that enhance or modify the behavior of user accounts.
  - The Decorator pattern allows for the dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects without modifying their core structure.
  - It can be used to add additional functionality or behavior to user accounts based on their achievements or roles.
