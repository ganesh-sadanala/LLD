- Any non-member (guest) can search and view questions. However, to add or upvote a question, they have to become a member.
- Members should be able to post new questions.
- Members should be able to add an answer to an open question.
- Members can add comments to any question or answer.
- A member can upvote a question, answer or comment.
- Members can flag a question, answer, or comment, for serious problems or moderator attention.
- Any member can add a bounty (https://stackoverflow.com/help/bounty) to their question to draw attention.
- Members will earn badges (https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges) for being helpful.
- Members can vote to close (https://stackoverflow.com/help/closedquestions) a question; Moderators can close or reopen any question.
- Members can add tags (https://stackoverflow.com/help/tagging) to their questions. A tag is a word or phrase that describes the topic of the question.
- Members can vote to delete (https://stackoverflow.com/help/deletedquestions) extremely off-topic or very low-quality questions.
- Moderators can close a question or undelete an already deleted question.
- The system should also be able to identify the most frequently used tags in the questions.


#### Use Cases

- Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:
  - StackOverflow likely follows the MVC architectural pattern to separate the application logic into three interconnected components: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (handles user input and updates the model and view).
  - This pattern promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the application more modular, maintainable, and easier to test.
- Repository Pattern:
  - The Repository pattern is often used to abstract the data access layer and provide a centralized place to manage data operations.
  - In StackOverflow, repositories can be used to handle database interactions, such as retrieving questions, answers, user profiles, and other entities, while hiding the complexities of the underlying data storage.
- Caching Pattern:
  - Given the high traffic and read-heavy nature of StackOverflow, caching can be employed to improve performance and reduce the load on the database.
  - Caching patterns like In-Memory Caching or Distributed Caching can be used to store frequently accessed data, such as popular questions, user profiles, or search results, in a fast-access cache.
- Decorator Pattern:
  - StackOverflow has features like badges and privileges that enhance or modify the behavior of user accounts.
  - The Decorator pattern allows for the dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects without modifying their core structure.
  - It can be used to add additional functionality or behavior to user accounts based on their achievements or roles.
- Composite Pattern:
  - Use case: Representing a hierarchical structure of questions and answers.
    - StackOverflow organizes questions and their associated answers in a hierarchical manner.
    - The Composite pattern can be used to treat individual questions and answers as well as groups of questions and answers uniformly.
    - This allows for easier manipulation and traversal of the question-answer hierarchy.
- Command Pattern:
  - Use case: Implementing user actions and undo/redo functionality.
    - StackOverflow allows users to perform various actions, such as posting questions, answering, commenting, and voting.
    - The Command pattern can be used to encapsulate each user action as an object, separating the request from its execution.
    - This enables the parameterization of clients with different requests and supports undoable operations.
    - For example, when a user posts a question, a PostQuestionCommand can be created and executed, and if needed, an UndoPostQuestionCommand can be used to revert the action.
- Template Method Pattern:
  - Use case: Handling the workflow of creating and publishing a question or answer.
    - StackOverflow follows a specific workflow when a user creates and publishes a question or answer.
    - The Template Method pattern can be used to define the skeleton of the workflow in a base class, while allowing subclasses to override or provide specific implementations for certain steps.
    - For example, a QuestionWorkflow template method can define the overall steps involved in creating and publishing a question, such as validation, tagging, and notification. Subclasses can provide specific implementations for each step based on the type of question (e.g., programming question, meta question).
